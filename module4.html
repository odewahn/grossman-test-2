<h1>Module 4 - Defining and Using Playing Cards</h1>

<p>Since blackjack is a game with playing cards, you now have to tell the Ruby interpreter what it needs to know about them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To do this you first have to define an object called CARD.&nbsp; This CARD object is a thing that the rest of your blackjack program can use.&nbsp;&nbsp; An object can contain data and methods.&nbsp; Data are just a group of variables related to that object and methods are things that the object can do. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The data for a playing card is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>name
	<ul>
		<li>name of the card as in Ace, Jack, Queen, King, 10, 9, 8, &hellip; 1</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>suit
	<ul>
		<li>either hearts, clubs, spades or diamonds</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>value
	<ul>
		<li>this says the point value of a card.&nbsp; Face cards all have a value of 10 in blackjack and numeric cards have a value equal to their number. The Ace may be either one or eleven but we are not going to worry about that right now.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>So when we crate a new card it will have a home for these three variables.&nbsp; These will be the <strong>data </strong>associated with each card.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>DEFINE AN OBJECT</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following Ruby code defines the <strong>Card</strong> object.&nbsp; Think of the <strong>object</strong> like a design of a playing card and an <strong>instance </strong>as an actual playing card.&nbsp; The object simply says playing cards have a suit and a value and an indicator as to whether or not the card has been played.&nbsp; The actual instance is an actual playing card.&nbsp;&nbsp; The code below in line 1 has the special keyword <strong>class</strong> which tells ruby we are defining an object named <strong>Card.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The special name <strong>attr_accessor </strong>is short for <em>attribute accessor </em>as <em>attribute</em> is another name for a variable associated with an object.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line 2 says you can view the values of the data in&nbsp;the variable <strong>name, </strong><strong>suit, </strong>and <strong>value</strong> once you create an <strong>instance</strong> of this object.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>ASSOCIATE DATA WITH THE OBJECT</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
class Card
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attr_accessor :name, :suit, :value&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
end

</pre>

<p>Once you have this code, you can launch the interactive ruby interpreter <strong>irb </strong>and get a feel for the object.&nbsp;</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
irb(main):005:0&gt;my_first_card = Card.new
=&gt; #&lt;Card:0x007fe259af
irb(main):006:0&gt; my_first_card.name
=&gt; nil
irb(main):007:0&gt; my_first_card.suit 
=&gt; nil
</pre>

<p>In this example with the Ruby interpreter, line 1 assigns the variable <strong>my_first_card </strong>to be an instance of the <strong>Card </strong>object.&nbsp; The keyword <strong>new </strong>tells the Ruby interpreter to create a new instance of this object.</p>

<p>To display the variable of a particular instance of an object we use the form <strong><em>instance.variable.&nbsp; </em></strong></p>

<p>Next in line 3 the statement <strong>my_first_card.name&nbsp; </strong>says to display the <strong>name </strong>variable of the object associated with <strong>my_first_card.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The ruby interpreter recognizes that <strong>my_first_card </strong>is an instance of the <strong>Card </strong>object and looks up the value of <strong>name </strong>for this instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case it returns <strong>nil </strong>as it has not been assigned.&nbsp; Similarly, line 5 requests <strong>my_first_card.suit </strong>which is also <strong>nil.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<h1>INITIALIZE AN OBJECT</h1>

<p>So the object we just looked at with the statement <strong>x&nbsp; = Card.new </strong>ended up with a card object being assigned to the <strong>x, </strong>but the values of <strong>name </strong>and <strong>suit </strong>were empty (e.g.; <strong>nil)</strong></p>

<p>To play blackjack, you need to be able to create a card like the King</p>
