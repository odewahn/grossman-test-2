<h1>Module 1 - Display a Welcome Message</h1>

<p>Let's make a game of Blackjack.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't know how to play the rules are <a href="blackjack.html">here:</a></p>

<p>Computers understand programming languages and <a data-type="link" href="#ruby_background">Ruby</a>&nbsp;is a good place for you to start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let's start by showing you how to communicate with&nbsp;the computer using Ruby.&nbsp; You must be precise, and if we misspell a word, well the computer is not going to understand it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want to display a welcome message. The command to do this is <strong>puts </strong>which is a shortened name for <strong>put string.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>Strings are sequences of characters or numbers that can be displayed on a screen,&nbsp;written to a file, or printed on a printer.&nbsp; You cannot add two strings together or divide by them.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; 4 divided by 2 makes sense.&nbsp; &quot;A&quot; divided by &quot;B&quot; doesn't.&nbsp; In many programming languages, double quotes (&quot;) are used to indicate that something is a string.</p>

<p>So now it's time to do it:</p>

<p>Type:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<pre data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Welcome to Blackjack&quot;</pre>

<pre data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
&nbsp;</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>inside of an environment that lets you enter Ruby commands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, it is going to be helpful if your own computer has Ruby installed.&nbsp; Detailed directions for installing the Ruby environment are included <a href="appb.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>You should see the message:&nbsp; Welcome to Blackjack.</p>

<p>In many programming languages books, the first thing they tell you to do is have the computer says HELLO&nbsp;WORLD.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that we just use the same puts command:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;HELLO WORLD.&quot;
</pre>

<p>Now that we showed you how to do it and you have it working, it's a good time to show you the kinds of things that can go wrong when writing programs.</p>

<p>Change your <strong>puts </strong>command to <strong>put</strong> as in:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
put &quot;Welcome to Black Jack&quot;
</pre>

<div data-nickname="petrycki" data-type="comment">
<div class="comment-identifier" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d4945bdcb61d40753a9fc1142633ff9e" />
<div spellcheck="false">petrycki</div>
<i class="delete_comment glyphicons remove_2">&nbsp;</i></div>

<p>You're going to need to change the flow based on the student having experienced the error. You don't have to tell them.</p>
</div>

<p>You'll get the following (which should send confusing thoughts to your brain and make you less sure that learning how to program is going to be so fun).&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust us, its an awesome feeling when you get something to work that you thought at the start that you might not be able to get it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>NoMethodError: undefined method `put' for main:Object</strong></p>

<p>You'll get a nice message of &quot;NoMethodError: undefined method for put&quot;. &nbsp; It is amazing anyone thinks computers are so smart.&nbsp; &nbsp; People are far more resilient.&nbsp; One little character. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is annoying that computers have to always care about every last little letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets take this error message piece by piece.</p>

<p>Well first it tells you the type of error you have followed by a colon. &nbsp;In this case you have a <strong>NoMethodError</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Well it turns out a <em>method</em> is piece of code that you might want to repeat. &nbsp;Terrific name isn't it. &nbsp; We will talk about this more later.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to jump to the section on methods just click here <a href="http://methodmodule">http://methodmodule.</a></p>

<div data-nickname="petrycki" data-type="comment">
<div class="comment-identifier" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d4945bdcb61d40753a9fc1142633ff9e" />
<div spellcheck="false">petrycki</div>
<i class="delete_comment glyphicons remove_2">&nbsp;</i></div>

<p>Another&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;for xref. In a book you're limited by the linear placement of pages. You could add something such as, &quot;If you're curious, skip to the methods module.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Some languages call it a <em>function</em> based on the mathematical definition of a function.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Math and in Computer Science, functions are used to make life easier to express equations. &nbsp; A simple function is <strong>f(x) = x + 2</strong>.&nbsp; This means whenever we send the <strong>f&nbsp;</strong> function a value for <strong>x, </strong>we want it to return a value that adds two to the value we sent.&nbsp; So if we ask for f(4), the result of the function is 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, &nbsp;you simplify your computer programs with methods and we'll get to all that later. &nbsp;We just wanted you to know its a thing that comes in handy to make it so you don't have to write the same programming code over and over.</p>

<p>So Ruby has a way to make it so you can define new methods. &nbsp;When you entered <strong>puts</strong>, that referenced a method that was written by the people who invented Ruby and its job is to output the string that follows to the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you got rid of the <em>s</em> in <em><strong>puts </strong></em>and just entered <strong>put</strong>, the ruby interpreter (the thing that processes each Ruby command) decided you must have written a new method called <strong>put.&nbsp; </strong>It looked for it and couldn't find it and gave you a <strong>NoMethodError. </strong></p>

<p>Now fix your PUT to PUTS and get it to work again. &nbsp; What a relief that is.</p>

<p>Ready for one more typo and its impact?</p>

<p>Lets get rid of the double quotes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>so your code will now look like</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
puts Welcome to Blackjack
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now you get a new error message

<p class="p1"><strong>NameError: undefined local variable or method `blackjack' for main:Object</strong></p>

<p>Well now the Ruby interpreter says you entered PUTS correctly so it was thinking you would follow it with a nice <strong>string. </strong>&nbsp; With quotes, the string has a value that is inside of the quotes, without quotes the string is assumed to be the name of an item that changes called a&nbsp;<strong>variable. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more on variables in <a href="http://module2">module 2.</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div data-nickname="petrycki" data-type="comment">
<div class="comment-identifier" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d4945bdcb61d40753a9fc1142633ff9e" />
<div spellcheck="false">petrycki</div>
<i class="delete_comment glyphicons remove_2">&nbsp;</i></div>

<p>Be careful when introducing new terms. As a reader, I may not know about variables. You don't define it until Module 2.</p>
</div>

<p>When you took off the quotes around <em>Welcome to blackjack</em> -- ruby thought you were referring to a variable named <em>WELCOME</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We never defined this variable so it then said <strong>undefined local variable</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
We showed you these two error messages for a reason. So if you end up getting one, you will have seen it before and you will know that probably it is some small issue that you have mistyped something.&nbsp; Sometimes you won't find the error because its a little like looking for spelling errors in your own e-mails (without a spell checker).&nbsp; You don't see the mistake because you are thinking you got it right.&nbsp; Sometimes it helps to take a break, go do something else for a few minutes, come back and look for the error again.

<p>Also, remember everything you type into a program should make sense to you.&nbsp; Don't just type something because its in a book or someone told you to do it, make sure it makes sense before you type it and you know what you are trying to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So fix the program you have written and we are ready to move on and get this game working.&nbsp;</p>

<pre data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="" data-type="programlisting">
puts Welcome to Blackjack&quot;
</pre>
&nbsp;
