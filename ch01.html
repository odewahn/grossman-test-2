    science, but programming is merely a strategy to implement computer
    science concepts. We introduce the basics of computer science using the
    Ruby programming language. Given our goal, we intentionally forgo many of
    the intricacies of the language.</p><p>Computer science is never tied to a programming language; it is tied
    to the task of solving problems efficiently using a computer. A computer
    comes with some resources, which will be discussed in <a href="#how_does_the_computer_really_work" data-type="xref"/>, such as internal memory
    for short-term storage, processing capability, and long-term storage
    devices. A <em>complete program</em> is a set of instructions
    that use the computer to solve a real problem. The tool for producing
    these instructions is called a <em>programming language</em>.
    The goal is to develop solutions that use these resources efficiently to
    solve real problems.</p><p>Programming languages come and go, but the essence of computer
    science stays the same. If we need to sort a sequence of numbers, for
    example, it is immaterial if we sort them using programming language A or
    B. The steps the program will follow, commonly referred to as the
    <em>algorithm</em>, will remain the same. Hence, the core goal
    of computer science is to study algorithms that solve real problems.
    Computer scientists strive to create a correct sequence of steps that
    minimize resource demands, operate in a timely fashion, and yield correct
    results.</p><p>Algorithms are typically specified using pseudocode. Pseudocode,
    which may itself be simply written in plain language, specifies the
    logical, conceptual steps that must occur without specifying the necessary
    details needed to actually execute each step. However, we think that a
    properly selected subset of Ruby is sufficiently simple to introduce the
    algorithms. So, instead of creating an algorithm by writing it in plain
    language, generating equivalent pseudocode, and transforming it into a
    programming language, we go straight from the plain-language definition of
    an algorithm to Ruby code.</p></section><section id="onedot2_application_development" data-type="sect1"><h1>1.2 Application Development</h1><p>When writing a program, it is important to keep in mind that the
    computer will do exactly what you tell it to do. It cannot think as a
    human would, so you must provide clear instructions for every step.</p><p>When giving instructions to others, people will often fill in blanks
    in logic without even realizing it. For example, if you instruct someone
    to “go to the bank,” you may not say what mode of transportation should be
    used. A computer, however, does not have the ability to “fill in the
    blanks.” A computer will only do exactly what you tell it to do.</p><p>Imagine, for example, explaining to a person and to a computer how
    to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. To the person, all you might
    need to say is, “Spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread, the jelly
    on the other slice of bread, and then put the pieces of bread together.”
    If these instructions were given to a computer, however, the computer
    would not know where to start. Implied in these instructions are many
    logical steps that a human can automatically infer and the computer
    cannot. For example, the human would know that the jar must first be
    opened to scoop peanut butter out before you can spread it onto a slice of
    bread. The computer might try to spread the actual jar across the bread,
    without taking the peanut butter or jelly out—assuming it could even find
    them!</p><p>Computer science is ultimately about problem solving. The following
    is a basic approach to solving problems:</p><ul class="simplelist"><li>Step 1: Understand the problem.</li><li>Step 2: Write out a solution in plain language.</li><li>Step 3: Translate the language into code.</li><li>Step 4: Test the code in the computer.</li></ul><section id="step_1_understanding_the_problem" data-type="sect2"><h2>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h2><p>During this step, you try to answer all questions about the
      problem at hand. For example, you may be asked to create a program that
      stores a list of names, like a directory. Instead of just creating this
      program with little forethought, it is important to know all the details
      of the problem. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><p>How many names will be stored?</p></li><li><p>Do first and last names need to be stored separately?</p></li><li><p>Are middle names needed?</p></li><li><p>What is the maximum length that a name can be?</p></li></ul></section><section id="step_2_write_out_the_solution_in_plain_l" data-type="sect2"><h2>Step 2: Write Out the Solution in Plain Language</h2><p>Once the problem is understood, the next step is to write an
      outline of how you will solve it. An example of the process of storing a
      name might look like a sequence of sentences:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Ask for the first name.</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Store the first name.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ask for the last name.</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Store the last name.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Optionally, ask for the middle
              initial.</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td><p>Store the middle
              initial.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section id="step_3_translate_the_language_into_code" data-type="sect2"><h2>Step 3: Translate the Language into Code</h2><p>Once the plain-language version is written, it is time to
      translate it into actual code. The Ruby code for the preceding example
      is shown in <a href="#english_rarr_ruby_code" data-type="xref"/>, but you are
      certainly not expected to understand it yet.</p><p>Note the pound sign (#) on the righthand side. This sign means
      that the remainder of the line is a <em>comment</em>. A
      comment is not part of the instructions given to the computer. That is,
      a comment is a nonexecutable segment of code. Typically, comments are
      used to explain what the code does. Not only is it critical to comment
      code for the sake of readability and understanding, but using comments
      is considered good programming style, and the liberal use of comments is
      essential. Always remember that you (or someone else) may have to fix
      errors—colloquially referred to as bugs—years after you write a program;
      comments will help you understand what your code does years after you
      initially wrote it.</p><div id="english_rarr_ruby_code" data-type="example"><h5>Plain language → Ruby code</h5><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ruby">        1 puts "Enter first name: "	# Ask for the first name

</pre></div></section><section id="step_4_test_the_code_in_the_computer" data-type="sect2"><h2>Step 4: Test the Code in the Computer</h2><p>This step entails running the program you created and seeing that
      it runs properly. It is best to test portions of your code as you write
      them, instead of writing an entire program only to find out that none of
      it works.</p></section></section><section id="onedot3_algorithms" data-type="sect1"><h1>1.3 Algorithms</h1><p>Algorithms are step-by-step methods of solving problems. The process
    of reading in names previously described is an example of an algorithm,
    though a very simple one. Some are extremely complicated, and many vary
    their execution depending on input. Often algorithms take input and
    generate output, but not always. However, all algorithms have something in
    common: they all do something.</p><div id="ch01note01" data-type="note"><h1>Gem of Wisdom</h1><p>Algorithms are the core of computer science. Correct and efficient
      algorithms guarantee that the computer works smart rather than only
      hard. Thus, think about the problem, come up with a good algorithm, and
      then determine how many steps the computer needs to complete the
      task.</p></div><p>Imagine a website like Google Maps, which has an algorithm to get
    directions from one point to another in either North America or Europe. It
    typically requires two inputs: a source and a destination. It also gives
    two outputs: the narrative directions to get from the source to the
    destination, and a map of the route.</p><p>The directions produced are also an algorithm; they accomplish the
    task of getting from the source to the destination. Imagine getting the
    directions to your friend’s house shown on the map in <a href="#directions_quotation_markalgorithmquotat" data-type="xref"/>.</p><ol><li><p>Start going south on River Road.</p></li><li><p>Turn left (east) on Main Street.</p></li><li><p>Take a right (south) on Ruby Lane.</p></li><li><p>Turn left (east) toward Algorithm Circle.</p></li><li><p>Continue until you come to 345 Algorithm Circle (your friend’s
        house).</p></li></ol><figure id="directions_quotation_markalgorithmquotat" style="float: 0"><img src="figs/cspr_0102.png"/><figcaption>Directions “algorithm”</figcaption></figure><p>First notice that the directions are numbered; each step happens in
    sequential order. Additionally, it describes general steps like, “Turn
    left (east) on Main Street.” It does not say, “Turn on your left turn
    signal and wait for the light to turn green, and then turn left on Main
    Street.” That is not the point of an algorithm. An algorithm does not need
    to write out every single detail, but it needs to have all the important
    parts.</p><section id="onedot3dot1_algorithm_efficiency" data-type="sect2"><h2>1.3.1 Algorithm Efficiency</h2><p>Different algorithms may accomplish the same task, but some will
      do it much faster than others. Consider the algorithm just described for
      going to your friend’s house, which certainly is not the only route to
      her or his home. Instead of getting on Ruby Lane, you could have hopped
      on the expressway, gone to the airport, and then taken a cab from the
      airport to your friend’s house—but that would be extremely inefficient.
      Likewise, there may be a more efficient route to your friend’s house
      than the one described. Just because you have created an algorithm does
      not make it efficient, and being able to create efficient algorithms is
      one of the factors that distinguishes a good computer scientist. For
      example, imagine receiving the following set of directions to your
      friend’s house instead of the ones shown in the previous section,
      illustrated on the map in <a href="#directions_quotation_markalgorit-id00001" data-type="xref"/>:</p><ol><li><p>Start going south on River Road.</p></li><li><p>Turn left (east) one block south of Main Street onto Algorithm
          Circle.</p></li><li><p>Continue until you come to 345 Algorithm Circle (your friend’s
          house).</p></li></ol><figure id="directions_quotation_markalgorit-id00001" style="float: 0"><img src="figs/cspr_0103.png"/><figcaption>Directions “efficient algorithm”</figcaption></figure><p>Here we use a different algorithm that accomplishes the same task,
      and it does so slightly more efficiently. That is, fewer turns are
      involved.</p></section></section><section id="onedot4_summary" data-type="sect1"><h1>1.4 Summary</h1><p>You now understand the core foundations of computer science, namely
    the use of algorithms to solve real-world problems. Ruby, as used
    throughout the remainder of the book, is a powerful, yet relatively easy
    to understand, programming language that can be used to implement these
    algorithms. It is, however, critical to remember that independent of the
    programming language used, without a good algorithm, your solution will be
    ineffective.</p><section id="onedot4dot1_key_concepts" data-type="sect2"><h2>1.4.1 Key Concepts</h2><ul><li><p>The essence of computer science is problem solving. Computer
