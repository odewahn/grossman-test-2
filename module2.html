<h1>Module 2: Get Input</h1>

<p>At this point, you have just been able to display some output to the screen telling the user that you want to play Blackjack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, it's time to ask the user for input.</p>

<p>Consider the following Ruby code:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Ready to Deal (y = yes, q = quit)&quot;
input = gets
</pre>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Line 1 shows the user being prompted with the </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">puts </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">command we learned about in module 1.&nbsp; Line 2 shows our new thing for today called the </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">gets </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">command.&nbsp; This is short for get-string.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Line 2 also has an important Ruby command called the <strong>Assignment operator</strong>.&nbsp; The equal sign is used here to indicate to take the thing on the right hand side of the equal sign and move it to a <strong>variable </strong>on the left hand side of the equal sign.</p>

<p>The general form of the assignment operator is:</p>

<p><em>variable = value</em></p>

<p>So we could issue the command:</p>

<p>x = 5</p>

<p>and this would assign the value 5 to the variable x.&nbsp; Think of a variable as just being a place in the computers memory that has an address just like your mailbox at home.&nbsp; Inside of that mailbox is a value.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a given point in time, the mailbox has one value.&nbsp; Since we can change the value in the mailbox, the mailbox is called a <strong>variable </strong>whose value can <strong>change </strong>or <strong>vary.&nbsp; </strong>Variables get used all the time in Mathematics;&nbsp;so, if you are familiar with them in mathematics,&nbsp;you&nbsp;will be comfortable with them here.&nbsp; For a full discussion of variables click <a href="https://atlas.oreilly.com/oreillymedia/computer-science-programming-basics-in-ruby-course/editor/master/ch03.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Some people see an equal sign and immediately associate it with an&nbsp;equation; in our context, it is not an equation. &nbsp;The equal sign indicates<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;an assignment of the right hand side of the equal sign to the left hand side.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If the statement were:</p>

<p><strong>5 = x </strong></p>

<p>(feel free to try it in the box below)</p>

<div data-nickname="ophirfrieder" data-type="comment">
<div class="comment-identifier" contenteditable="false"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/05709fcdca3c601800012a6267ca9a6d" />
<div spellcheck="false">ophirfrieder</div>
<i class="delete_comment glyphicons remove_2">&nbsp;</i></div>

<p>Box missing!!!!</p>
</div>

<p>you would get the error message:&nbsp;<strong>syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting </strong></p>

<p><strong>end-of-input </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ruby interpreter sees the equal sign after the number 5 and realizes that you are trying to move some value in an actual number or literal value.&nbsp; A literal cannot be changed, it only has the value of 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Ruby interpreter says it was expecting you to be done when it found the equal sign and you were not done so syntax error is generated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you hit the enter key, a newline character is added to the input. So if you just says</p>

<p><strong>x = gets</strong></p>

<p>and the user enters YES and then hits enter, the value &quot;YES\n&quot; is now stored in <strong>x </strong>where the <strong>\n </strong>indicates a new line character.</p>

<p>This <strong>\n </strong>is usually going to get in your way, so a handy Ruby method called <strong>chop </strong>is used to chop off the newline character. &nbsp; If we did not use chop any time we wanted to compare the user response we would have to include the &quot;\n&quot; which is time consuming and clutters up our program. &nbsp;So we chop off the &quot;\n&quot; and we can focus on the core user response. &nbsp; Sometimes we do need to care if a newline exists and in those cases we would not chop off the &quot;\n&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The command <strong>x = gets.chop </strong>will take the user input string, remove the <strong>\n </strong>and then store the rest in the variable <strong>x. </strong></p>

<p>For our blackjack game we use the following:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ruby" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
puts &quot;Ready to Deal (y = yes, q = quit)&quot;
input = gets.chop</pre>

<p>You are now ready to see if the user has entered a <strong>y </strong>for YES to play Blackjack or a <strong>q </strong>to indicate they are done with the game and the <strong>chop </strong>method makes it so you do not have to worry about matching the <strong>\n </strong>character when determining if the user entered a <strong>q </strong>or a <strong>y. </strong></p>
